1. Create a new ternary Expr class.
    - Expr conditional
    - Expr trueChoice
    - Expr falseChoice

2. Create a new comma Expr class.
    - Expr left
    - Expr right

3. Add break and continue statements.
    - only effect closest loop
    - works inside of if statements
    - finds closest loop
    - don't execute any code in the loop after either break or continue
    - don't hack around with blocks - refer to the actual loop  (while (true) if (true) break)
